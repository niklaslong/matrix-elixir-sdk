# Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
    
Please avoid using overtly sexual aliases or other nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.
  
Please be kind and courteous. There’s no need to be mean or rude.
    
Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.
    
Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.
    
We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone. That is not welcome behavior. In particular, we don’t tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.
  
Private harassment is also unacceptable. Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.
  
No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact [Niklas Long](mailto:niklaslong@protonmail.ch). Whether you’re a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you and we’ve got your back.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant, version 2.0](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html) and by the Rust-lang Code of Conduct.

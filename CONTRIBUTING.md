# Contributing

First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute!

Issues and pull requests are very welcome for bug reports and feature requests and/or proposals. Please provide as much detail as possible, as this will facilite communication. 

All code needs to include programmatic tests, documentation and to have been tested manually. Tests will run on [the repo's CI], and should pass before asking for a PR review.

If you're interested in contributing to the project long term (every skill level welcome), let us know [over email](mailto:niklaslong@protonmail.ch) and we'll onboard you through a call and invite you to our matrix room. 

Please note that for all communication and interactions we expect our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to be followed.

# Contributing

First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute!

Issues and pull requests are very welcome for bug reports and feature requests and/or proposals. Please provide as much detail as possible in the descriptions. 

All code needs to include programmatic tests, documentation and to have been tested manually. Tests will run on the repo's CI, and should pass before asking for a PR review.

If you're interested in contributing to the project long term (every skill level welcome), let us know [over email](mailto:niklaslong@protonmail.ch) and we'll onboard you through a call and invite you to our matrix room. 

Please note that for all communication and interactions we expect our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to be followed.
